<h1>File-handlers</h1>
<hr>
File handling appendages :P

<h3>CSV_handler</h3>--> a <b>List[Dict]</b> object that corresponds to your csv file data<br>
Also includes a run time refresh method that allows you to accomodate for the changes done by other programs to your csv file
<br> <br>
<h3>text_python</h3> --> Allows to convert a datastructure into a string and vice versa<br>
Inpspired from JSON but accounts for tuples and sets too!<br>
Dumping and Loading from a file is still a work under progress :P
